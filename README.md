# kdkasad's forks

A collection of projects which I ([kdkasad](https://github.com/kdkasad)) have forked in order to develop fixes and/or contributions.
None of the repositories in this organization are entirely my own work.

Since GitHub does not allow organization of repositories on a user's profile page, I've elected to move all of the repositories which are just forks containing few or minor changes to a separate organization. This serves to make it easier to tell which projects are actually mine on my profile page while  also allowing me to keep these forked repositories around.
